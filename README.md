## Hey, I'm **[gonza](https://www.gonza.uno/)**
It's good to see that you have been interested in understanding this repository.<br><br>



First of all I want to thank Bob Ziroll ([@bobziroll](https://twitter.com/bobziroll)) 
who was my guide in the development adventure of this project, 
during the **[Scrimba Frontend Developer Path](https://scrimba.com/)** âœ¨<br><br><br><br>






#### Creation of the React project template using Vite:
```bash
npm create vite@latest ./ -- --template react
```

<br>

#### Dependencies that were used, along with the command to install them:

* **NanoId**
_Official website: https://github.com/ai/nanoid_

* **React Split**
_Official website: https://split.js.org/_

* **React Markdown Editor**
_Official website: https://github.com/andrerpena/react-mde_ 

* **Showdown**
_Official website: https://showdownjs.com/_

```bash
npm install -legacy-peer-deps nanoid react-split react-mde showdown
```

<br>

#### To finish the project setup is necessary to update the package.json so that the React and React-dom dependencies are from version 17.0.2. So they will not conflict with the other dependencies
